    <h1>JavaScript is fun and CSS and HTML too!</h1>

    <p class="first">
      You can learn JS without HTML and Css but it's better to know them for dom
      manipulation. You can go to my site
      <a href="https://www.amberorrange.me">here.</a>

    <img
      id="course-image"

    />

    <form id="your-name">
      <h2>Your name here</h2>
      <p class="first">please fill in this form:</p>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
      <button>Okay!</button>
    </form>

<!-- 
  -inline vs block elements: inline happens on the same line currently on (example <a> tag)
  -block elements will start a new line (ex h1 element)
Ex: href is an attribute that describes what the link is for the anchor tag  
      <a href="https://www/amberorrange.me">This goes to my site.</a>
Another example is an img tag that uses the src attribute so it knows what source to get the image from 
          <img
      src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/358042/pexels-photo-358042.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=pexels-pixabay-358042.jpg&fm=jpg"/>
You'll notice no closing tag on img bc there's nothing that actually goes in between two tags for an image 
-diff elements will have diff atributes that make sense for them 
-there are two attributes that we can use on ALL elements that we can use to identify them: classes and ids-used to name elements so that we can select them in css and style them; also used to select elements in js for dom manipulation, especially classes
-classes: can be added inside the tag itself
ex:     <p class="first"> This is the text </p>

-ids: diff between classes and ids is that ids have to be unique!!!! and classes do not; in practice, we almost never use ids to style elements or select them from js. its better practice to use classes

ex:  <img id="course-image"
      src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/358042/pexels-photo-358042.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=pexels-pixabay-358042.jpg&fm=jpg"/>

-idea of creating creating boxes: aka div. can make boxes or divs
-id/class names: to separate words with a dash is conventional syntax bc this is the way css does it 

-some elements are better to use in certain use cases over div element: for example the form element 

   <form id="your-name">
      <h2>Your name here</h2>
      <p>please fill in this form:</p>
      <input type="text" placeholder="Your name" />
      <button>Okay!</button>
    </form>

    -its important for semantic html

<!-- Basic styling with CSS:
-we use CSS to style elements and create the layout for theoverall page
-can use the style element inside html file inside of the head element
-inside the style element you can use different selectors
-for example you can use an element selector to select all elements of a certain type, for example you can select the whole body; then inside the selector, use curly braces to add CSS declarations; 

  <style>
      body {
        background-color: green;
      }
    </style>

-CSS declarations consist of a property name and then a value; so background-color: property name and value is green;
  
-it is better practice to create a separate CSS file (like style.css) and link it to the html file 

-you can use the link element to connet to a separate css file. again use the href attribute to add the name of the file (relative location of the files being connected is also important)

    <link href="csspractice.css" rel="stylesheet" />
